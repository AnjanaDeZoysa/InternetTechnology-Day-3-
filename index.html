            <td>Built between the 5th century B.C. and the 16th century, the Great Wall of China is a stone-and-earth
                fortification created to protect the borders of the Chinese Empire from invading Mongols. The Great Wall
                is actually a succession of multiple walls spanning approximately 4,000 miles, making it the world's
                longest manmade structure.<br>

                        <li>History<br>
                            Origins: The earliest walls were built in the 7th century BC by various states to defend
                            against nomadic tribes. These were later connected and expanded by the Qin Dynasty (221â€“206
                            BC) under Emperor Qin Shi Huang, who is often credited with unifying the walls.
                            Ming Dynasty: The most well-known sections were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368â€“1644)
                            after the Mongol invasions. This era saw the wall reinforced with bricks and stone, making
                            it more durable.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Structure<br>
                            Design: The wall varies in height and width, with some sections reaching up to 30 feet tall.
                            It includes watchtowers, beacon towers, and troop barracks, designed for both defense and
                            communication.
                            Materials: Depending on the region, materials ranged from tamped earth to bricks. Some areas
                            were built using local materials, which gives each section a unique look.

                        <li>Cultural Significance<br>
                            Symbol of Strength: The Great Wall is often viewed as a symbol of China's historical
                            strength and determination.
                            UNESCO World Heritage: Designated in 1987, it highlights the wall's cultural importance and
                            its role in Chinese history.

                            Inception: The idea for the statue emerged in the 1920s, with the intention of creating a
                            symbol of Christianity in Brazil.
                            Construction: It was constructed between 1922 and 1931, designed by Brazilian engineer
                            Heitor da Silva Costa and sculpted by French artist Paul Landowski.
                            Dedication: The statue was officially inaugurated on October 12, 1931, and has since become
                            an iconic representation of Rio and Brazil.

                            outstretched arms representing openness and acceptance.
                            Cultural Icon: Beyond its religious significance, the statue has become a national symbol of
                            Brazil and is recognized worldwide.

                by the Incas. The site remained unknown except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by

                            Inca Civilization: Machu Picchu was built in the 15th century during the reign of the Inca
                            emperor Pachacuti. Itâ€™s believed to have been a royal estate or a sacred religious site.
                            Rediscovery: Although locals were aware of its existence, it was brought to international
                            attention in 1911 by American historian Hiram Bingham.

                            Best Time to Visit: The dry season (May to September) is ideal for visiting, though it can
                            be crowded. Early mornings or late afternoons offer a quieter experience.
                            Tickets: Entrance is limited to manage the number of visitors, so itâ€™s advisable to book
                            tickets in advance.
